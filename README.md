# What is speedsters?

A macOS, Windows, and Linux app for inspecting your javascript, [React JS](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) performance.

# Why?
While developing on a React-native application I notice that once the application becomes large the Chrome Devtools
starts to be very slowly and hard to debug the performance of the Application, even though I start with the
React-Native that doesn't mean you can't use with your React web App.
